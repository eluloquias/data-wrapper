I chose this question because I boarded a ~~horrendous~~ lovely flight recently to Jamaica where there were several unruly children on the plane, and they interrupted my sleep on the 7 hour red-eye flight multiple times. The question lingered in my head. Constantly. 

The chart shows that the **majority** of respondents **(702 out of 849)** believe that bringing unruly children on a plane is rude to some extent. A smaller portion of respondents **(147 out of 849)** believe that bringing unruly children on a plane is not rude at all.

This indicates a strong consensus that bringing unruly children on a plane is generally considered rude, with majority of the people surveyed believing it impacts the experience of other passengers.
